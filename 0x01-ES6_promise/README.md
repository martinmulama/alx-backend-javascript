## Introduction

Asynchronous programming ES6 async...await

## Asynchronous Programming

Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows tasks to be performed concurrently, enabling non-blocking execution of code. This is particularly important for tasks that may take time to complete, such as network requests or file I/O operations.

## Promises

Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations more elegantly in JavaScript. They represent a value that may be available now, or in the future, or never. Promises have three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. They are used to avoid callback hell and make asynchronous code more readable.

## Async/Await

`async/await` is a syntactic feature introduced in ECMAScript 2017 (ES8) that simplifies working with promises. It provides a more concise and synchronous-looking syntax for handling asynchronous operations, making code more readable and maintainable.

### Example using Promises

```javascript
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Asynchronous operation
    // Resolve or reject the promise based on the result
  });
}

// Using the promise
fetchData()
  .then(data => console.log('Data:', data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
